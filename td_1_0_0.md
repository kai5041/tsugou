## Initialize a new tsu project

```sh
$ tsu init [template]
```
This command creates a `.tsu` directory in the current folder.  
The `template` argument is optional and can specify a predefined project template.


The anatomy of a tsu project is as follows:

```bash
.tsu/
├── config.json       # Project configuration file
├── history           # Contains a log of all commits
├── branches          # Associates branch names with branch hashes
├── commits/          # Directory containing commit files
│   ├── commit_timestamp_1
│   ├── commit_timestamp_2
│   ├── ...
│   └── commit_timestamp_n
```

### Configuration files

#### config.json
```json
{
  "project_name": "<project name>",
  "project_version": "<project version>",
  "author": "<author name>",
  "current_branch": "<branch name>",
  "tsugou_version": "<tsugou version>",
  "scripts": {
    "<script name>": "<script command>"
  }
}
```

#### history:
```bash
<commit_hash_1> <branch_1> <author_1> <timestamp_1> <message_1>
<commit_hash_2> <branch_2> <author_2> <timestamp_2> <message_2>
...
<commit_hash_n> <branch_n> <author_n> <timestamp_n> <message_n>
```

Each commit in the `commits` folder is a file named after its timestamp.
> **NOTE:** Timestamps are in the unix format in milliseconds.
